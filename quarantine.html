    <h1>My Quarantine Story</h1>
    <img src="aloni.jpg">
    <p>Previous days to all this disaster I was walking to my home I found this huge teddy bear in the garbage. 
      I found it funny, but at the same time I started to think about what was really coming to this country. 
      I felt fear, I felt confused, I was worried about my family and people I love.</p>
    <img src="what.jpg">
    <p>I think this picture reflects people desperation in these times. 
      Even though, it seems funny and maybe stupid, I do not blame those people, I think we all go crazy at least once in life.
